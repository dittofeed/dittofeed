# dittofeed-lite

The dittofeed-lite project encapsulates the dittofeed-dashboard, dittofeed-api, and dittofeed-worker services into a single more easily runnable service.

This is great for users who are looking for an easy way to get started running dittofeed, but users running with significant production workloads are encouraged to run dittofeed's services separately.
