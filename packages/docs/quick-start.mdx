title: Quick Start
---

To get started with Dittofeed, you'll need do the following:

1. Deploy Dittofeed. You can self-host or use our [cloud offering](/deployment/cloud).
2. Send Dittofeed your user data.
3. Integrate a messaging channel.
4. Create a user journey.

Currently, we recommend that users self-host with docker compose, and ingest
data from segment. We currently support email messaging via sendgrid.
