description: "Send data directly to Dittofeed's segment compatible API."
---

Workspace members can send data directly to Dittofeed's segment compatible API. This is useful if you want to circumvent an external source integration, like Dittofeed's [segment integration](/integrations/sources/segment).

This source of Dittofeed events is especially useful when self-hosting, as it allows you to send user data to Dittofeed without it ever being sent to a third party server.

## Endpoints

Dittofeed's API is compatible with [segment's API](https://segment.com/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/server/http-api/).

- [`/api/public/apps/identify`](/api-reference/endpoints/apps/identify)
- [`/api/public/apps/track`](/api-reference/endpoints/apps/track)
- [`/api/public/apps/page`](/api-reference/endpoints/apps/page)
- [`/api/public/apps/screen`](/api-reference/endpoints/apps/screen)

## Authentication

Dittofeed's API uses Write Keys to authenticate requests. You can find your Write Key in your workspace settings [`/dashboard/settings#settings#write-key-title`](https://dittofeed.com/dashboard/settings#settings#write-key-title).

Include write keys as an HTTP `Authorization: Basic ...` header in your requests. It's safe to include this write key in your
client (e.g. your web client javascript payload).
