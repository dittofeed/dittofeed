Enable Dittofeed's Hubspot integration to sync information back into Hubspot. The integration can be enabled on the settings page: [/dashboard/settings#hubspot-integration](https://app.dittofeed.com/dashboard/settings#hubspot-integration).

This integration allows you to sync segments as Hubspot lists, and user emails as Hubspot engagements.

## Hubspot Lists

Add contacts to [Hubspot lists](https://knowledge.hubspot.com/lists/create-active-or-static-lists), mirroring the users present in the select segments.
