## Tracking

To receive Resend tracking data, you'll need to create a webhook in Resend.

Go to the Webhooks settings page. [https://resend.com/webhooks](https://resend.com/webhooks)

Create a new webhook with the following actions to be posted.

- Bounced
- Clicked
- Complained
- Delivered
- Sent

<Info> The "Opened" action can also be used, but it is not recommended as it can drastically reduce deliverability. Additionally, Dittofeed does not currently support the "Delivery Delayed" action.</Info>

Use the Post URL `https://app.dittofeed.com/api/public/webhooks/resend` or your own custom domain if you're self-hosting.

Click "Add" to add the webhook.

You'll be redirected to the page for your new webhook. Copy the signing secret.
