title: Send Email with a SMTP Server
---

Dittofeed can integrate with basic SMTP servers to send emails. Many third-party email services exist for testing the quality and deliverability of your emails, such as [Mailtrap](https://mailtrap.io/). Using SMTP as an email provider is useful for integrating with these services.

Note that we don't recommend using SMTP for production email delivery. With a plain SMTP server, you'd lose access to spam and delivery rate metrics, which dedicated email service providers are able to provide via their relationships with ISPs.

## Integration Instructions

Navigate to the [/dashboard/settings](https://dittofeed.com/dashboard/settings) page SMTP section.
