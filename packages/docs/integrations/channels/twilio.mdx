Dittofeed can integrate with Twilio to send SMS.

## Integration Instructions

Once you've created a twilio account there are a few necessary pieces of information you'll need to provide to Dittofeed:

1. Your Twilio Account SID
2. Your Twilio Auth Token
3. Your Twilio Messaging Service SID

These can be input in the settings page [dashboard/settings#sms-channel](https://app.dittofeed.com/dashboard/settings#sms-channel)
