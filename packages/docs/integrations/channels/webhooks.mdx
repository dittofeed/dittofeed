title: Triggering Webhooks with Dittofeed
---

The Webhook channel is Dittofeed's most versatile channel, allowing API requests to be sent to any number of services. This is great for:

- Sending messages with your own internal API's.
- Supporting messaging channels which Dittofeed hasn't built out dedicated support for.

These use cases span:

- Slack messaging.
- Native mobile push.
- Triggering messages from an internal, proprietary email API.

and more.
