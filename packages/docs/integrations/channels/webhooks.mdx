title: Triggering Webhooks with Dittofeed
---

The Webhook channel is Dittofeed's most versatile channel, allowing API requests to be sent to any number of services. This is great for:

- Sending messages with your own internal API's.
- Supporting messaging channels which Dittofeed hasn't built out dedicated support for.

These use cases span:

- Sending Slack messages.
- Native mobile push.
- Triggering messages from an proprietary email or SMS API's.

and more.

Webhook channels work by rendering JSON configuration which configures an outgoing HTTP request. For more information on configuring Webhook messages, see the [Webhook editor documentation](/resources/templates/webhook-editor).
