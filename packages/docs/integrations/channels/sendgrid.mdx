## Tracking

In order to receive sendgrid tracking data, you have to create a webhook in SendGrid.

Go to the Webhook settings page. [https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/mail_settings/webhook_settings](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/mail_settings/webhook_settings)

Create a new webhook with the following actions to be posted.

- Opened
- Clicked
- Spam Reports
- Dropped
- Bounced
- Delivered
- Processed

With the Post URL `https://app.dittofeed.com/api/public/webhooks/sendgrid` or your own custom domain if you're self-hosting.

Enable the "Signature Verification" feature. Save the webhook.
