Dittofeed's [Web SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dittofeed/sdk-web) allows you to send events from your web app to Dittofeed's API.

## Installation

```bash
# Using Yarn
yarn add @dittofeed/sdk-web

# Using NPM
npm install --save @dittofeed/sdk-web
```

## Usage

```typescript
import { DittofeedSdk } from '@dittofeed/sdk-web';

// Initialize the sdk with a writeKey, which is used to identify your
// workspace. This key can be found at
// https://dittofeed.com/dashboard/settings
await DittofeedSdk.init({
  writeKey: "Basic abcdefg...",
});

// Lets you tie a user to their actions and record traits about them. It
// includes a unique User ID and any optional traits you know about the
// user, like their email, name, and more.
DittofeedSdk.identify({
  userId: "123",
  traits: {
    email: "john@email.com",
    firstName: "John"
  },
});

// The track call is how you record any actions your users perform, along
// with any properties that describe the action.
DittofeedSdk.track({
  userId: "123",
  event: "Made Purchase",
  properties: {
    itemId: "abc",
  },
});

// Lets you record whenever a user sees a screen, the mobile equivalent of
// page, in your mobile app, along with any properties about the screen.
DittofeedSdk.screen({
  userId: "123",
  name: "Recipe Screen",
  properties: {
    recipeType: "Soup",
  },
});

// Lets you subscribe a user to a subscription group.
DittofeedSdk.subscribe({
  userId: "123",
  subscriptionGroupId: "23b5757f-15a5-4477-858f-a96913b2a3f1",
});

// Lets you unsubscribe a user from a subscription group.
DittofeedSdk.unsubscribe({
  userId: "123",
  subscriptionGroupId: "23b5757f-15a5-4477-858f-a96913b2a3f1",
});

// Ensures that asynchronously submitted events are flushed synchronously
// to Dittofeed's API.
await DittofeedSdk.flush();
```

### Anonymous Users

The SDK will automatically generate an anonymous ID for users who are not logged in. This ID is stored in the user's browser and is used to track them across different sessions.

You can submit events with the anonymous ID using any of the methods that accept a `userId` parameter, by omitting the `userId` parameter.

```typescript
DittofeedSdk.identify({
  traits: {
    email: "john@email.com",
  },
});
```

You can access the anonymous ID using the `getAnonymousId` method.

```typescript
const anonymousId = DittofeedSdk.getAnonymousId();
```

You can also reset the anonymous ID using the `resetAnonymousId` method.

```typescript
DittofeedSdk.resetAnonymousId();
```


### Install the Snippet

You can also import the Dittofeed snippet into your web app. This snippet will automatically load the Dittofeed SDK and initialize it with your write key.

This is convenient if you want to use the Dittofeed SDK without a build system e.g. in a site builder like Webflow.

```html
<script type="text/javascript">
  var _df = _df || [];

  (function () {
    var methods = ["track", "identify", "page", "flush", "subscribe", "unsubscribe", "getAnonymousId", "resetAnonymousId"];
    methods.forEach(function (method) {
      _df[method] = function () {
        _df.push([method].concat(Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments)));
      };
    });

    var script = document.createElement("script");
    script.type = "module";
    script.async = true;

    // If you're self-hosting the Dittofeed dashboard, you'll need to to
    // specificy your own host.
    script.src = "https://app.dittofeed.com/dashboard/public/dittofeed.umd.js";

    script.id = "df-tracker";
    // Replace with your own write key found on: https://app.dittofeed.com/dashboard/settings
    script.setAttribute("data-write-key", "Basic my-write-key");
    // If you're self-hosting dittofeed, you'll need to to specificy your own host.
    // script.setAttribute("data-host", "http://localhost:3001");

    document.head.appendChild(script);
  })();

  _df.identify({
    userId: "123",
    email: "test@email.com"
  });
</script>

```
