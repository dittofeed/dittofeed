To get started with Dittofeed, you'll need do the following.

1. Deploy Dittofeed. You can self-hosted, or use our cloud offering<sup>*</sup>.
2. Send Dittofeed your user data.
3. Integrate a messaging channel.
3. Create a user journey.

<sup>*</sup> **Coming Soon**

Currently, we recommend that users self-host with docker compose, and ingest
data from segment. We currently support email messaging via sendgrid.
