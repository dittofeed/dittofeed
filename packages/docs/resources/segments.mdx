Segments are one of the most important Dittofeed resouces to understand. Segments are used to define a group of users. Segments serve multiple roles.

Segment uses:

- In [Journey Entry Nodes](/resources/journey-nodes/entry) to determine which users enter a journey.
- In [Journey Segment Split Nodes](/resources/journey-nodes/segment-split) to direct users along a specific path within journeys.

Segments are defined by composing one or more segment nodes in a hierarchy.

- [Performed Node](/resources/segment-nodes/performed): Restrict a segment to users who have performed a specific action.
- [And Node](/resources/segment-nodes/and): Allow any users to join the segment if they satisfy one condition "And" another condition.
- [Or Node](/resources/segment-nodes/or): Allow any users to join the segment if they satisfy one condition "Or" another condition.
- [Subscription Group Node](/resources/segment-nodes/subscription-group): Restrict a segment to members of a subscription group.
- [Manual Node](/resources/segment-nodes/manual): Specify a segment by manually uploading a CSV of users.
