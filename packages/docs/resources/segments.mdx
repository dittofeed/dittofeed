Segments are one of the most important Dittofeed resouces to understand. Segments are used to define a group of users. Segments serve multiple roles.

Segment uses:

- In [journey entry nodes](/resources/journey-nodes/entry) to determine which users enter a journey.
- In [journey segment split nodes](/resources/journey-nodes/segment-split) to direct users along a specific path within journeys.

Segments are defined by composing one or more segment nodes in a hierarchy.

## Segment Nodes

- [Trait Node](/resources/segment-nodes/trait): Restrict a segment to users with a specific trait value.
- [And Node](/resources/segment-nodes/and): Allow any users to join the segment if they satisfy one condition "And" another condition.
- [Or Node](/resources/segment-nodes/or): Allow any users to join the segment if they satisfy one condition "Or" another condition.
- [Broadcast Node](/resources/segment-nodes/broadcast): Allows segments to be receive broadcasts, to manually trigger Journeys.
- [Subscription Group Node](/resources/segment-nodes/subscription-group): Restrict a segment to members of a subscription group.
