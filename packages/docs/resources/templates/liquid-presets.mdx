Dittofeed comes with a number of built-in liquid tags, filters. These are available to use in your templates. These serve as useful utility functions for rendering messages.

## Tags

### `unsubscribe_link`

The `unsubscribe_link` tag outputs a link to unsubscribe from the message's [subscription group](/resources/subscription-groups). 

```html
{{ unsubscribe_link }}
```

This renders a link of the form,

```html
<a class="df-unsubscribe" clicktracking=off href="..." target="_blank">unsubscribe</a>
```

This tag is only usable in templates used within a [journey message node](resources/journey-nodes/message) that has been assigned a [subscription group](/resources/subscription-groups), and will otherwise produce an empty href.

The link's text can also be overridden by passing a parameter to the tag e.g.

```html
You can unsubscribe by clicking {{ unsubscribe_link here }}.
```

Including an `unsubscribe_link` is critical for marketing emails, for both legal and user experience reasons. It should be included in the footer of your email, along with your company name, and address e.g.

```html
<mj-text align="center" color="#525252">
  MyCompany, Inc., 40 Rosewood Lane, New York, NY 10003
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Don't want to receive these emails? You can {% unsubscribe_link %} from them here.
