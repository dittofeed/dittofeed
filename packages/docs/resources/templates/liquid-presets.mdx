Dittofeed comes with a number of built-in liquid tags, filters. These are available to use in your templates. These serve as useful utility functions for rendering messages.

## Tags

### `unsubscribe_link`

The `unsubscribe_link` tag outputs a link to unsubscribe from the message's [subscription group](/resources/subscription-groups). 

```html
{% unsubscribe_link %}
```

This renders a link of the form,

```html
<a class="df-unsubscribe" clicktracking=off href="..." target="_blank">unsubscribe</a>
```

This tag is only usable in templates used within a [journey message node](resources/journey-nodes/message) that has been assigned a [subscription group](/resources/subscription-groups), and will otherwise produce an empty href.

The link's text can also be overridden by passing a parameter to the tag e.g.

```html
You can unsubscribe by clicking {% unsubscribe_link here %}.
```

Including an `unsubscribe_link` is critical for marketing emails, for both legal and user experience reasons. It should be included in the footer of your email, along with your company name, and address e.g.

```html
<mj-text align="center" color="#525252">
  MyCompany, Inc., 40 Rosewood Lane, New York, NY 10003
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Don't want to receive these emails? You can {% unsubscribe_link %} from them here.
  <br/>
  <br/>

```

#### Channel Display Behavior

By default, when a user clicks an unsubscribe link, they will see subscription groups for only the channel they are unsubscribing from (e.g., if unsubscribing from an email, they'll only see email subscription groups). This behavior can be controlled by the `show_all_channels` setting when rendering the template.

**Default behavior** (show only relevant channel):
```html
<!-- Standard unsubscribe link - shows only the relevant channel -->
{% unsubscribe_link %}
```

**Show all channels**:
```html
<!-- Show all subscription groups across all channels -->
{% unsubscribe_link show_all_channels:true %}

<!-- With custom link text and show all channels -->
{% unsubscribe_link show_all_channels:true Click here to unsubscribe %}
```

### `unsubscribe_url`

If you need to customize the unsubscribe link, you can use the `unsubscribe_url` tag to only output the URL.

```html
<a class="df-unsubscribe" clicktracking=off href="{% unsubscribe_url %}" target="_blank">unsubscribe</a>
```

This tag follows the same channel display behavior as `unsubscribe_link` - by default showing only the relevant channel's subscription groups, unless `show_all_channels` is set to `true` during template rendering.

**Examples**:
```html
<!-- Default behavior - shows only relevant channel -->
<a class="df-unsubscribe" href="{% unsubscribe_url %}" target="_blank">unsubscribe</a>

<!-- Show all channels -->
<a class="custom-unsubscribe" href="{% unsubscribe_url show_all_channels:true %}" target="_blank">
  Unsubscribe from all communications
</a>
```

### `subscription_management_link`

The `subscription_management_link` tag outputs a link to the subscription management page without automatically unsubscribing the user. This allows users to manage their subscription preferences manually.

```html
{% subscription_management_link %}
```

This renders a link of the form,

```html
<a class="df-subscription-management" clicktracking=off href="..." target="_blank">manage subscriptions</a>
```

The link's text can also be overridden by passing a parameter to the tag e.g.

```html
You can {% subscription_management_link manage your subscription preferences %}.
```

This tag is useful when you want to provide users with access to subscription management without automatically changing their subscription status upon page load.

#### Channel Display Behavior

The subscription management page accessed via this link will always show subscription groups for all channels, allowing users to comprehensively manage their preferences across email, SMS, and other messaging channels.

### `subscription_management_url`

If you need to customize the subscription management link, you can use the `subscription_management_url` tag to only output the URL.

```html
<a class="df-subscription-management" clicktracking=off href="{% subscription_management_url %}" target="_blank">manage subscriptions</a>
```

This tag follows the same channel display behavior as `subscription_management_link` - always showing subscription groups for all channels.
