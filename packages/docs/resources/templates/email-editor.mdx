Dittofeed provides an email template editor through the dashboard, which supports [Liquid syntax](https://liquidjs.com/tutorials/intro-to-liquid.html), HTML, and [MJML](https://mjml.io/). Learn more about coding responsive emails in MJML in [the next section](/resources/templates/mjml).

## Sending Email Attachments

Dittofeed supports sending email attachments.

<Warning>
  When possible, you should include links to files in your email instead of attaching them. Email attachments can have a substantial negative impact on email's deliverability.

  * Email attachments are often used by malicious actors to distribute malware.
  * Email with attachments are often marked as spam.
</Warning>

Sending email attachments requires using `File` [type user properties](/resources/user-property-types/file). First, create a user property that will capture the file you're interested in sending.

<Frame>
  ![File User Property](/images/file-user-property.png)
</Frame>

Then, include a reference to this file in your template, by clicking on "Options".
