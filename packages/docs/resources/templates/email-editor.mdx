Dittofeed provides two forms of email template editing:

1. A notion like low-code editor that makes it easy to compose primarily text-based emails.
2. A code-based editor that supports Liquid, HTML, and MJML.

## Low-code Editor

The low-code editor provides a notion-like interface for composing lightly styled emails. Blocks are inserted into the template by typing the `/` key and selecting the desired block from the list of suggestions.

Text can be formatted by highlighting the text and selecting the desired formatting options from the toolbar that appears.

## Code-based Editor

The code-based email editor supports [Liquid syntax](https://liquidjs.com/tutorials/intro-to-liquid.html), HTML, and [MJML](https://mjml.io/). Learn more about coding responsive emails in MJML in [the next section](/resources/templates/mjml).

An example of a rendered "welcome email" template using MJML and Liquid:

## Sending Email Attachments

Dittofeed supports sending email attachments.

<Warning>
  When possible, you should link to files using a URL rather than sending them as attachments. Email attachments can have a substantial negative impact on emails' deliverability.

  * Email providers often send emails with attachments to spam.
  * Email attachments are often used by malicious actors to distribute malware.
</Warning>

Sending email attachments requires using `File` [type user properties](/resources/user-property-types/file). First, create a user property that will capture the file you're interested in sending.

  ![File User Property](/images/file-user-property.png)
</Frame>

Then, include a reference to this file in your template, by clicking on "Options".

</Frame>

Finally, send a track event with the files you'd like to attach.

```json
{
  "type": "track",
  "files": [
    {
      "type": "Base64Encoded",
      "name": "my_file_name.pdf",
      "mimeType": "application/pdf",
      "data": "base64-encoded-file-data"
    }
  ],
  "properties": {
    ...
  },
  ...
}
```

## Custom Recipient Property

By default, emails are sent to the user's `email` property. You can override this by selecting a different user property in the template's "Recipient User Property" setting, accessible via the "Options" button.

This is useful for:
- **Alternative contact methods**: Send to a user's work email instead of personal email
- **Third-party notifications**: Send to a user's manager, support agent, or parent

See [Custom Recipient Properties](/guide/custom-recipient-properties) for detailed configuration and important notes about unsubscribe links.
