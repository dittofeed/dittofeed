title: "Webhook Template Editor"
---

Dittofeed provides a Webhook template editor for rendering webhook request configurations.

## Configuration

```json
{
    "config": {...},
    "secret": {...}
}
```

The `config` object and `secret` object accept the same values, modeled after [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) [request configuration](https://axios-http.com/docs/req_config).

| Parameter      | Example                                 | Description                                           |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `url`          | `"https://api.com/users"`               | `url` is the server URL that will be used for the request |
| `method`       | `"POST"`                                | `method` is the request method to be used when making the request |
| `headers`      | `{ "Authorization": "Basic abc123" }`   | `headers` are custom headers to be sent              |
| `params`       | `{ "id": 123 }`                         | `params` are the URL parameters to be sent with the request |
| `data`         | `{ "firstName": "fred" }`               | `data` is the data to be sent as the request body    |
| `responseType` | `"json"`                                | Allowed options are "json" and "text"                |


The difference between `config` and `seceret` is that the `secret` values:

1. Override the config values.
2. Are not rendered into the stored `DFInternalMessageSent` events, ensuring that sensitive information is leaked to Dittofeed's event store.

These features of the secret object are useful for storing sensitive information, such as API keys. API keys for the webhook channel can be set on the settings page, at [`/dashboard/settings#webhook-channel`](https://dittofeed.com/dashboard/settings#webhook-channel).

## Identifier Key

The webhook template editor also allows you to configure an identifier key. This key serves several purposes, including managing subscriptions, handling webhook based delivery updates, and more.

This value should be the user property which identifies the user with respect to the channel you are contacting them on e.g. the users email, their phone number, or their device token in the case of mobile push.
