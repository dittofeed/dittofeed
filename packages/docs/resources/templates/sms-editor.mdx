## Custom Recipient Property

By default, SMS messages are sent to the user's `phone` property. You can override this by selecting a different user property in the template's "Recipient User Property" setting, accessible via the "Options" button.

This is useful for:
- **Alternative contact methods**: Send to a user's work phone instead of personal phone
- **Third-party notifications**: Send to a user's manager, support agent, or parent

See [Custom Recipient Properties](/guide/custom-recipient-properties) for detailed configuration.
