Broadcasts are useful for manually triggering journeys. This is useful for sending one-off messages to a group of users, or for testing journeys.

See the [broadcast segment node](/resources/segment-nodes/broadcast), which is required for configuring a journey which can receive broadcasts.

Steps involved in sending a broadcast include:

1. Create a segment with a broadcast node.

2. Use that segment as the entry condition for a journey.

3. Send a broadcast to that segment.
