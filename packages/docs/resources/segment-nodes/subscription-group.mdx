The subscription group segment node is restricted to users who are currently within a subscription group.

## Example Use Case - Messaging Users Who Subscribe

You may decide to send a message thanking all users who subscribe to your newsletter. To do this you can create a "Newsletter" subscription group, create a subscription group segment referring to it, and then a journey using that segment.
