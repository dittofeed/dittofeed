The subscription group segment node is restricted to users who are currently within a subscription group.

## Example Use Case - Subscription Group Broadcasts

["And" segment nodes](/resources/segment-nodes/and) are commonly combined with [broadcast segment nodes](/resources/segment-nodes/broadcast) and subscription group nodes to allow you to broadcast to users in a specific subscription group.

In this case, this allows you to manually trigger (broadcast) a message to all users who are subscribed to the "Weekly Newsletter" subscription group.
