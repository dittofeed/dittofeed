"And" segment nodes allow you to combine two or more conditions using the logical AND operator. This means that the user must satisfy all of the conditions in order to join the segment.

## Example Use Case - New Team Creator

You may want to message a user that has created a team, and who has joined the platform recently. You can do this by creating a segment with two conditions:

1. User has created a team, performing the `CREATE_TEAM` action.
2. User has a `createdAt` trait within the last day.
