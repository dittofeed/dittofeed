"And" segment nodes allow you to combine two or more conditions using the logical AND operator. This means that the user must satisfy all of the conditions in order to join the segment.

## Example Use Case - Subscription Group Broadcasts

"And" segment nodes are commonly combined with [broadcast segment nodes](/resources/segment-nodes/broadcast) and [subscription group nodes](/resources/segment-nodes/subscription-group) to allow you to broadcast to users in a specific subscription group.

In this case, this allows you to manually trigger (broadcast) a message to all users who are subscribed to the "Weekly Newsletter" subscription group.
