This segment node type is necessary to use use [broadcasts](/resources/broadcasts). A user enters a broadcast segment when they receive a mannually triggered broadcast event.

## Example Use Case - Subscription Group Broadcasts

["And" segment nodes](/resources/segment-nodes/and) are commonly combined with broadcast segment nodes and [subscription group nodes](/resources/segment-nodes/subscription-group) to allow you to broadcast to users in a specific subscription group.
