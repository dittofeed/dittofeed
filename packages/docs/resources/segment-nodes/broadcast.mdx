This segment node type is necessary to use use [broadcasts](/resources/broadcasts). A user enters a broadcast segment when they receive a mannually triggered broadcast event.

## Example Use Case - Subscription Group Broadcasts

"And" segment nodes are commonly combined with [broadcast segment nodes](/resources/segment-nodes/broadcast) and [subscription group nodes](/resources/segment-nodes/subscription-group) to allow you to broadcast to users in a specific subscription group.

In this case, this allows you to manually trigger (broadcast) a message to all users who are subscribed to the "Weekly Newsletter" subscription group.
