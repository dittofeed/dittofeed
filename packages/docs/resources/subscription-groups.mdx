## Introduction

Subscription groups help you manage groups of specific end users, and their messaging preferences. They are important both for obtaining end user's trust, as well as achieving regulatory compliance.

Subscription groups are associated with a specific channel e.g. email, SMS, or push. One can have multiple subscription groups per channel. Subscription groups can be assigned to journey message nodes, to allow those messages to render unsubscribe links, and to ensure that users are not messaged unless they are subscribed to the relevant subscription group.

## Creating a Subscription Group

By default, workspaces are populated with one subscription group per channel. Additional subscription groups can be created via [`/dashboard/subscription-groups`](https://demo.dittofeed.com/dashboard/subscription-groups) page.

To create a new subscription group, click the (+) button. Then edit the subscription group name, and press save.

## Opt-In vs Opt-Out Subscription Groups

There are two types of subscription groups, opt-in, and opt-out.

### Opt-In Subscription Groups

Opt-in subscription groups require end users to explicitly subscribe to the subscription group.

They are a great option for newsletters, and other marketing messages, where you want to ensure that users are actively interested in receiving messages.

### Opt-Out Subscription Groups

Opt-out subscription groups automatically include all users, unless they explicitly unsubscribe. They are great for messages which users are likely to want to receive. For example, an email notifying user of a new friend invitations on a social network.

## Adding and Removing Users from a Subscription Group

Users can be added and removed from subscription groups either programmatically, or manually via the dashboard. Understanding how to add users to subscription groups is important for opt-in subscription groups, which will be empty by default.

### CSV Upload

Users can be added to subscription groups with csv uploads. To do so navigate to a particular subscription group's upload page `/dashboard/subscription-groups/upload/[id]`.

The provided CSV file should have the following format.

```csv users.csv
id,email,firstName,lastName
d1bdf186-7dd9-485e-9f93-6e0e3f3e6b8a,johndoe@example.com,John,Doe
f5c5d1e5-d1f5-4d65-8b8f-7d4d153c4a51,janedoe@example.com,Jane,Doe
a4ef2311-cd4c-4e5d-9d21-7c3e8b29c7b1,alice@example.com,Alice,Johnson
b8c5cd71-214d-4d62-92a4-85e9e4d4efbe,bob@example.com,Bob,Smith
7b73a62c-bfd2-4a8a-ba9f-bfcbfd234c89,charlie@example.com,Charlie,Brown
```

Either the `id` or `email` field must be present. If both are present, the `id` field will be used to identify the user. If neither are present, the upload will fail. Non-identifying fields such as `firstName` and `lastName` are optional and will map to user traits.

I'm writing the documentation for a service that is broadly similar to Braze, Customer.io, Segment engage and other multi-channel customer engagement platforms. I'd like you to write a page which documents subscription groups, with background information provided below.

This platform has "resources" that represent the configuration of a "workspace". Workspaces have "subscription groups" that allow users to subscribe, and unsubscribe from messages. Subscription groups are assigned to a "channel" e.g. the email channel, sms channel etc. Subscription groups can be either Opt-In (end users are members IFF they have subscribed), or Opt-Out (users are members of the subscription group so long as they haven't explicitly unsubscribed). This functionality is similar to Braze's "Subscription Groups" feature, and is necessary to comply with regulations like the CAN-SPAM act. There's also a subscription manager page hosted from the dashboard that's accessible to end users and can be used to manage their subscriptions. Unsubscribe links in emails route to this page, which unsubscribes the user on page load in addition to displaying their subscriptions on the page.

Before you write the contents of the page, please write out an outline of the page, and the headings you would use (in markdown syntax). Please also write a short paragraph describing the documentation page, and what it would contain.

## Introduction

### What are Subscription Groups?

Subscription Groups are like buckets where you put different types of messages—like emails, SMS, push notifications—that users can choose to receive or not. Imagine a user says, "Sure, I'd love your emails" (that's opt-in), or "No more promotional texts, please" (that's opt-out). These groups help you send the right stuff to the right people and give your users control over what they get.

### The Importance of Subscription Groups in Regulatory Compliance

Besides helping you manage messages and keep users happy, Subscription Groups also keep you on the right side of the law. Some laws, like the CAN-SPAM Act in the U.S., say you must let people opt out of your messages easily. With Subscription Groups, users can opt in or opt out with a few clicks, helping you follow the rules, respect user choices, and build trust.

## Types of Subscription Groups

When it comes to Subscription Groups, there are two main types: Opt-In and Opt-Out. The primary difference is how users join or leave these groups. Each type serves a specific purpose in managing your communications, depending on the level of user engagement you're aiming for.

### Opt-In Subscription Groups

Opt-In Subscription Groups are the kind where users have to actively say, "Yes, I want this." When a user subscribes to an Opt-In group, they're giving you the green light to send messages through that channel. It's like signing up for a newsletter or deciding to get alerts from a particular blog.

### Opt-Out Subscription Groups

Opt-Out Subscription Groups are the default. Users are automatically included in these groups. But just like they can turn off notifications from an app on their phone, they can unsubscribe from an Opt-Out group whenever they want. Until they say "No more, thanks," you can continue to send messages through that channel.
