User properties are a powerful feature in Dittofeed that allow you to define how user events are aggregated to be rendered in your templates.

User properties are also used to identify users when contacting channel providers. For example, the `email` property is used to identify users when sending emails.

## Default User properties

Dittofeed comes pre-populated with a set of default user properties.

- `email`: The user's email address. Used to identify users when sending emails.
- `phone`: The user's phone number. Used to identify users when sending SMS messages.
- `deviceToken`: The user's device token. Used to identify users when sending push notifications.

- `lastName`: The user's last name.
- `language`: The user's language.
- `accountManager`: The user's account manager.
- `id`: The user's unique identifier, provided by your system. This user property cannot be deleted or changed.
- `anonymousId`: The user's anonymous identifier, provided for logged out users. This user property cannot be deleted or changed.

## User Property Examples

For example, when rendering an email, you can use the `firstName` user property to personalize the email.

```html
<body>
    Hey {{ user.firstName | default: "there" }}
</body>
```
