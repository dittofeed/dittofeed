For example, an entry node might be assigned a "Stagnant Onboarding" segment, which includes all users who have had `status='onboarding'` for more than 24 hours. This journey might then send users an email encouraging them to finish onboarding with additional instructions.

- n number of instances of journey per user.
- user enter synchronously, when event occurs.
