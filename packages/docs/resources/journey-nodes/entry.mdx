title: "Entry - Journey Node"
description: "Define who is allowed to enter a Journey."

All journeys have an entry node. An entry node defines who is allowed to enter the journey, and when they enter it.

There are two types of journey entry nodes, Segment Entry Nodes and Event Entry Node. Users enter journeys with Segment Entry Nodes when they enter specified corresponding segment. Users enter journeys with Event Entry Nodes immediately, when they trigger a specified event.

## Segment Entry

Users enter journeys with Segment Entry Nodes when they enter specified corresponding segment.

Segment Entry Nodes are useful for what might traditionally considered marketing messaging. For example, drip campaigns, onboarding, or re-engagement campaigns.

Journeys with Segment Entry Nodes have at most one instance per user.

### Example Use Case - Welcome email

For example, an entry node might be assigned a "New Users" segment as described [here](/resources/segment-nodes/trait#example-use-case-new-users), which includes all users who have a `createdAt` date within the last 24 hours. This journey might encourage users to finishing setting up their prorfile, and inform them about new features.


## Event Entry

Users enter journeys with Event Entry Nodes immediately, when they trigger a specified event. Event Entry Nodes are useful for what might traditionally considered transactional messaging. For example, journeys with Event Entry Nodes are appropriate for sending order confirmation, password reset, or order cancellation emails.

With every matching event, a new instance of the journey is created for the user. This is in contrast to Segment Entry Nodes, where only one instance of the journey can exist at any given time for each user.

## The Role of Message Ids

In Dittofeed, message id's are used to uniquely identify events. In the case of journeys with Event Entry Nodes, the message id of the triggering event is used to identify the journey instance, and to ensure if you accidentally send duplicate events with the same message id, the user will not receive duplicate messages.

In most cases, events' message id's can safely be assigned an arbitrary unique value, like a UUID. However, when sending events that used to trigger Event Entry Nodes, one should ideally assign a message id that identifies the corresponding operation in the context of your application.

For example, when sending an event to trigger a journey for an order cancellation, the message id might be `order-cancelled-${orderId}`.

## With Performed User Properties

## Limitations


outline:
- n number of instances of journey per user.
- user enter synchronously, when event occurs.
- useful for what might traditionally considered transactional messaging.
- uses messaqe id of triggering event as they key used identify the journey instance.
- user properties

### Example Use Case - Order Cancellation

- message-id: ` ``order-cancelled-${orderId}`` ` e.g. order-cancelled-123
