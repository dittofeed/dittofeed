description: "Define who is allowed to enter a Journey."

All journeys have an entry node. An entry node requires a segment, which defines who is allowed to enter the journey.


## Example

<Frame>

</Frame>

For example, an entry node might be assigned a "Stagnant Onboarding" segment, which includes all users who have had `status='onboarding'` for more than 24 hours. This journey might then send users an email encouraging them to finish onboarding with additional instructions.
