Delay nodes allow you to cause users to wait an arbitrary amount of time before they progress until the next step. Unlike other platforms, Dittofeed doesn't impose any limitations on the duration of delays. Seconds, hours, days, weeks, months, it's all fair game!

## Example Use Case - Welcome Email

For example, a delay node might be used in a journey to send a welcome email, wait a week, then send another email thanking them for joining.
