title: "Performed - User Property"

Performed user properties select the last observed `property` value of a `track` event.

<Info> `Performed` user properties are calculated synchronously from within [event entry Journeys](/resources/journey-nodes/entry#event-entry). This guarantees that the user property value will incorporate the triggering events' properties when rendering message templates within the journey. </Info>

## Example Use Case - Last Purchased Item

As an example, imagine you are running an e-commerce application. You might create a `lastPurchasedItem` user property, to track the last item that a user purchased.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/last-purchased-item-up.png" />
</Frame>

```json
{
  "type": "track",
  "userId": "1234",
  "event": "purchase",
  "properties": {
    "item": {
      "name": "orange socks"
    }
  }
}
```

This property would then be available to render in a template.


```html
{{ user.lastPurchasedItem | default: "this amazing item" }}!
```
