title: "Trait - User Property"
---

Trait user properties selects the last observed `trait` value of an `identify` event. It is the most basic and commonly used user property type.

## Example Use Case - Plan

As an example, imagine that you're running a SAAS business, where users can be subscribed to one of several plans. You can create a `plan` trait.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/plan-up.png" />
</Frame>

```json
{
  "type": "identify",
  "userId": "1234",
  "traits": {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@email.com",
    "plan": "premium"
  }
}
```

This property would then be available to render in a template.

```html
You are subscribed to the {{ user.plan | default: "free" }} tier plan.
```
