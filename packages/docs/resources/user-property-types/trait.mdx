title: "Trait - User Property"
---

Trait user properties selects the last observed `trait` value of an `identify` event. It is the most basic and commonly used user property type. They can be used to render individual values, or to render arrays and objects.

## Example Use Case - Plan

As an example, imagine that you're running a SAAS business, where users can be subscribed to one of several plans. You can create a `plan` trait.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/plan-up.png" />
</Frame>

```json
{
  "type": "identify",
  "userId": "1234",
  "traits": {
    "plan": "premium",
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@email.com"
  }
}
```

This property would then be available to render in a template.

```html
You are subscribed to the {{ user.plan | default: "free" }} tier plan.
```

## Example Use Case - Recommendations

Let's say you're running an online store, and you want to show recommendations to a user. You have a set of recommendations for each user that you've pre-calculated. You can create a `recommendations` trait, and use it to render a list of products.

```json
{
  "type": "identify",
  "userId": "1234",
  "traits": {
    "recommendations": [
      {
        "id": "123",
        "name": "Laundry Detergent"
      },
      {
        "id": "456",
        "name": "Toothpaste"
      }
    ],
    "name": "John Doe"
  }
}
```


```html
{% for product in user.recommendations | default: empty %}
  <mj-text><a>href="https://example.com/product/{{ product.id }}">{{ product.name }}</a></mj-text>
{% endfor %}
```

This is a demonstration of how `Trait` user properties can be used to render arrays and objects in addition to strings.
