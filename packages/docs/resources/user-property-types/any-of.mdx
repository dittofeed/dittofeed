Any Of user properties can be used to select the most recent value provided by a collection of sub-properties.

## Example Use Case - Social Media Platform.

Let's say you're running a social media platform. You're tracking a number of events from the platform, including:

- Subscriptions to creators.
- Likes on a creators' posts.
- Comments on creators' posts.

You want to be able to target users with a message with content related to the last creator they interacted with, across each of these event types. You can use an Any Of user property to do this.
