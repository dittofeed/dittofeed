title: "File - User Property"

File user properties capture the value of a `file` values sent in a `track` event, as a base 64 encoded string. These values can then be used to send email attachments.

For example, one might create a `File` type user property to capture to send receipt's for a purchase. Then, this file will be assigned as a user property value, which is accessible in templates.

```json
{
  "type": "track",
  "userId": "1234",
  "messageId": "72b988f9-97f9-42dd-aeac-75e154cf50e8",
  "event": "purchase",
  "files": [
    {
      "type": "Base64Encoded",
      "name": "receipt.pdf",
      "mimeType": "application/pdf",
      "data": "base64 encoded string"
    }
  ],
  "properties": {
    "orderId": "123456"
  }
}
```

<Info>
Like `Performed` [user properties](/resources/user-property-types/performed), `File` user properties are calculated synchronously from within [event entry Journeys](/resources/journey-nodes/entry#event-entry). This allows you to include files in the same track event used to trigger journeys, and guarantee that the file is used to render message templates for those journeys.
