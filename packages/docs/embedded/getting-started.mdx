In this guide, we'll walk you through the steps to embed Dittofeed in your application.

## 1. Obtain an Parent Admin API Key

Reach out to the Dittofeed team to obtain a Parent Admin API Key for your parent workspace. This key will be used to authenticate your requests to the Dittofeed API.

- Email: [support@dittofeed.com](mailto:support@dittofeed.com)
- Discord: [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/HajPkCG4Mm)


## 2. Create a Child Workspace

Create a child workspace. You can optionally associate this with an `externalId` if you have a business entity or customer in your own system that you want to associate with the workspace. This will make accessing the workspace more convenient.

Use the [PUT /api-l/admin/workspaces/child](/api-reference/auto/workspace/put-api-ladminworkspaceschild) endpoint to create a child workspace.

```bash
curl -X PUT \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <parent-admin-api-key>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "My Customer Business", "externalId": "1234567890", "workspaceId": "<parent-workspace-id>"}' \
  https://app.dittofeed.com/api-l/admin/workspaces/child
```

This will respond with the child workspace id and write key.

```json
{
  "id": "6eed2156-606a-4666-925e-7f89adddd743",
  "name": "My Customer Business",
  "externalId": "1234567890",
  "writeKey": "Basic OTQ0MjNkNzctMzA0Ni00MDBhLTgxMDYtMTM2ZTIzZmQyMzE2OjQ3YjRlYzExOTM3NDE3MjU=",
  "type": "Child",
  "status": "Active"
}
```

Make sure to store the write key, which will be used to submit events to the child workspace.

## 3. Create a Session Token

Use the [POST /api-l/sessions](/api-reference/auto/sessions/post-api-lsessions) endpoint on your backend to create a session token.

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <write-key>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"workspaceId": "<child-workspace-id>"}' \
  https://app.dittofeed.com/api-l/sessions
```

This will respond with a session token.

```json
{
  "token": "1234567890"
}
```

This token can then be passed to your frontend, and used to embed Dittofeed components until it expires. By default, the session token expires in 1 hour.

## 4. Embed Dittofeed Components

Take your session token and pass it to the Dittofeed components which can be loaded via an iframe.
