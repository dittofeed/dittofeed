In this guide, we'll walk you through the steps to embed Dittofeed in your application. We'll create a simple welcome journey, that sends an email to new users.

## 1. Obtain an Parent Admin API Key

Reach out to the Dittofeed team to obtain a Parent Admin API Key for your parent workspace. This key will be used to authenticate your requests to the Dittofeed API.

- Email: [support@dittofeed.com](mailto:support@dittofeed.com)
- Discord: [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/HajPkCG4Mm)


## 2. Create a Child Workspace

Create a child workspace. You can optionally associate this with an `externalId` if you have a business entity or customer in your own system that you want to associate with the workspace. This will make accessing the workspace more convenient.

```bash
```

Make sure to save the write key.

## 3. Create Resources in the Child Workspace

Create a journey, a email template, and segment.

## 4. Submit Events to the Child Workspace

## 5. Create a Session Token

## 6. Embed Dittofeed Components
