## Action

A step in a messaging journey which carries out pre-defined work if its trigger is activated. Imagine a simple journey where a new user is messaged with a welcome email. The trigger is the new user being saved to your database, and the action is the welcome email being sent to the user.

{/* ## Campaign

An organized marketing effort to promote brand awareness or sell a product. Customer engagement platforms like Dittofeed are used to distribute high volumes of messages to users in ways which are consistent with campaign goals. For instance, Company X is launching a campaign around a new feature with the goal of converting free users to paid users. Company X knows that Demographic Y is most inclined to like the feature. So, the company builds a journey which segments users by demographic, and sends Demographic Y messages at regular time intervals with content about feature benefits and use cases. */}

{/* ## CDP

An acronym for “customer data platform”. CDPs are databases designed specifically to aid in crafting complete views of individual customers. They also provide simple ways to send and receive customer information to and from business intelligence tools and marketing software. */}

## Channel

A messaging outlet. Some commonly used channels include email, SMS, Slack, and in-app messaging. Customer engagement platforms which are "omni-channel" provide tools that allow messaging to be sent across all channels.

## Event

A discrete unit of user activity or inactivity within an application or on a website. A user placing items in a shopping cart and a user abandoning a cart can each be considered events.

## In-app Messaging

Messaging that happens within an application. SaaS companies will often deploy this type of messaging to remind users of features they aren’t using and to give them helpful advice on how to get the most out of the software.

## Integration

Dittofeed integrates with third party applications and services for three purposes.

* Data Source Integration: Imports user data into Dittofeed.
* Destination Integration: Exports user data from Dittofeed.
* Channel Integration: Used to message users.

## Journey

A sequence of triggers and actions which automate the process of sending well-timed, relevant messaging to users. Journeys (also known as workflow campaigns) allow companies to automatically split users into segments, add time delays to messages, send different messaging templates based on user behavior, and much more.

Journeys automate communicating with users about things like:

* Onboarding
* Promotions
* Cart abandonment
* Loyalty programs
* Newsletters
* New feature rollouts

## Reverse ETL

"ETL" stands for "extract, transform, load”, and refers to the process of exporting warehoused data to business applications, like Dittofeed, CRM's, and more.

Popular data warehouses include Snowflake, Amazon Redshift, and Google BigQuery. Popular data destinations include Salesforce, Tableau, and Amplitude.

## Segment

A subset of users defined by specific parameters like demography, app usage metrics, and message responses. For example, Company X has users across the world who use their app to varying degrees, but the company only wants to send a particular message to its North American users who don't use the app very often. Segmentation could be used to identify these users in order to message them.

## Template

A standardized messaging layout, often with a visual design and variable input fields which can be programmatically altered to personalize messages.

{/* ## Trigger

Triggers are created by assigning events to them and placing them before a desired action within a journey. ”Event” and “trigger” are sometimes used interchangeably. However, events happen outside of a journey (on your app, website, etc.), while triggers happen within journeys. For example, a user clicks on a “buy” button on Company X’s website, and this click is saved as an event in the company’s database. The company then decides to create a journey to message every user who clicks on the “buy” button (the “event”), so they make a trigger that listens for this specific event and activates a “message send” action each time the event occurs. */}

## Webhook

Webhooks allow producer applications to "push" data into consumer applications' API's, rather than "pull" that data from a conventional synchronous API. Webhooks allow consuming applications to receive live updates from the sending application, while avoiding polling.

Webhooks are frequently used to synchronize data sources across applications and services. For example, Dittofeed is capable of consuming [segment.com](segment.com)'s webhooks in order to receive updates to its user data.

## Workflow

Another term for a journey. Workflows are sequences of triggers and actions.
