Dittofeed optionally utilizes an s3 compatible blob storage to support features which require storing files. This includes file attachments and in the future image hosting.

## Configuration

```bash
ENABLE_BLOB_STORAGE=true
# The endpoint of the blob storage e.g. s3 endpoint
BLOB_STORAGE_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:9010
# The access key id for the blob storage
BLOB_STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY_ID=admin
# The secret access key for the blob storage
BLOB_STORAGE_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=password
# The bucket to use for the blob storage
BLOB_STORAGE_BUCKET=dittofeed
# The region of the blob storage
BLOB_STORAGE_REGION=us-east-1
```

We recommend creating a dedicated bucket for Dittofeed to use.
