title: "Upgrading from v0.22.0 to v0.23.0"
---

Upgrading from v0.22.0 to v0.23.0 is a multi-step process.

1. Running the pre-upgrade script from the admin-cli.
2. Updating the dittofeed image tag.
3. Running the post-upgrade script from the admin-cli.

<Warning>
If you are on a version of dittofeed prior to v0.20.0, you will need to upgrade to v0.20.0 prior to upgrading to v0.23.0. See the [Upgrading from v0.19.0 to v0.20.0](/deployment/self-hosted/upgrade-guide/v0-20-0) guide for more information on upgrading to v0.20.0.
</Warning>

## Upgrade Dittofeed in Docker Compose

### Step 1: Setting Up Your `docker-compose.lite.yaml` File

First, add the environment variable `BOOTSTRAP: "false"` to your `docker-compose.lite.yaml` file, if it isn't set already. This will prevent your lite instance from running bootstrap operations when it restarts.

Next, make sure you have an `admin-cli` instance specified in our `docker-compose.lite.yaml` file. We'll be using this service to run our migrations.

Your `docker-compose.lite.yaml` file should look something like this:

```yaml
...
services:
  lite:
    image: dittofeed/dittofeed-lite:${IMAGE_TAG:-v0.22.0}
    restart: always
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    depends_on:
      - postgres
      - temporal
      - clickhouse-server
    environment:
      <<: *backend-app-env
      # uncomment while upgrading dittofeed
      BOOTSTRAP: "false"
    env_file:
      - .env
    networks:
      - dittofeed-network-lite
  # useful for upgrading dittofeed
  admin-cli:
    # the admin-cli should be on the new version v0.23.0 of dittofeed
    image: dittofeed/dittofeed-admin-cli:${IMAGE_TAG:-v0.23.0}
    entrypoint: []
    profiles: ["admin-cli"]
    command: tail -f /dev/null
    tty: true
    depends_on:
      - postgres
      - temporal
      - clickhouse-server
    environment:
      <<: *backend-app-env
    env_file:
      - .env
    networks:
      - dittofeed-network-lite
...
```

### Step 2: Start the `admin-cli` Service

Next, run the following command to start your `admin-cli` service:

```bash
docker compose --profile admin-cli -f docker-compose.lite.yaml up admin-cli -d
```

### Step 3: Run the Pre-Upgrade Script

Run the pre-upgrade script to run postgres migrations and create the new clickhouse tables and views:

```bash
./scripts/admin-lite.sh upgrade-0-23-0-pre
```

### Step 4: Upgrade Your `docker-compose.lite.yaml` File

Upgrade the version in your docker-compose.lite.yaml file to v0.23.0:

```yaml
...
services:
  lite:
    image: dittofeed/dittofeed-lite:${IMAGE_TAG:-v0.23.0}
...
```

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.lite.yaml up lite -d --force-recreate
```

### Step 5: Run the Post-Upgrade Script

```bash
./scripts/admin-lite.sh upgrade-0-23-0-post
```

### Step 6: Stop the `admin-cli` Service

Finally, stop the `admin-cli` service:

```bash
docker compose --profile admin-cli -f docker-compose.lite.yaml stop admin-cli
```

## Upgrade Dittofeed in Kubernetes

### Step 1: Setting Up Your dittofeed `values.yaml` File

First, add the environment variable `BOOTSTRAP: "false"` to your `values.yaml` file for the dittofeed helm chart, if it isn't set already. This will prevent your lite instance from running bootstrap operations when it restarts.

```yaml values.yaml
env:
  - name: BOOTSTRAP
    value: "false"
```

### Step 2: Install the `dittofeed-admin-cli` Chart

Next, run the following command to install the `dittofeed-admin-cli` chart:

```bash
helm upgrade --install dittofeed-admin-cli ./dittofeed/helm-charts/dittofeed-admin-cli
```

Make sure that the `dittofeed-admin-cli` pod is running the version of the `dittofeed-admin-cli` chart that you're upgrading to.

```yaml chart.yaml
appVersion: "v0.23.0"
```

Or set the `tag` in your `values.yaml` file to `v0.21.0`:

```yaml values.yaml
image:
  tag: v0.21.0
```

### Step 3: Run the Pre-Upgrade Script

Run Dittofeed's database migrations before deploying the new version of Dittofeed:

Exec into the `dittofeed-admin-cli` pod:

```bash
kubectl exec -it deployment/dittofeed-admin-cli -- /bin/bash
```

Run the migrations:

```bash
./admin.sh upgrade-0-23-0-pre
```

### Step 4: Upgrade the Dittofeed Chart

Update the `tag` in your `values.yaml` file to `v0.23.0`:

```yaml values.yaml
image:
  tag: v0.23.0
```

Upgrade the dittofeed chart:

```bash
helm upgrade --install dittofeed ./dittofeed/helm-charts/dittofeed
```

### Step 5: Run the Post-Upgrade Script

Run the post-upgrade script after the dittofeed chart is upgraded:

```bash
./admin.sh upgrade-0-23-0-post
```

### Step 6: Uninstall the `dittofeed-admin-cli` Helm Chart

Finally, uninstall the `dittofeed-admin-cli` deployment:

```bash
helm uninstall dittofeed-admin-cli
```
