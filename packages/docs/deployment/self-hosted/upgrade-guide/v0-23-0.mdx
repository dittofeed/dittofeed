Upgrading from v0.22.0 to v0.23.0 is a multi-step process.

1. Running the pre-upgrade script from the admin-cli.
2. Updating the dittofeed image tag.
3. Running the post-upgrade script from the admin-cli.

<Warning>
If you are on a version of dittofeed prior to v0.20.0, you will need to upgrade to v0.20.0 prior to upgrading to v0.23.0. See the [Upgrading from v0.19.0 to v0.20.0](/deployment/self-hosted/upgrade-guide/v0-20-0) guide for more information on upgrading to v0.20.0.
</Warning>

## Update Your `docker-compose.lite.yaml` File

Update the `image` tag in your `docker-compose.lite.yaml` file to `v0.23.0`:

```yaml
services:
  lite:
    image: dittofeed/dittofeed-lite:${IMAGE_TAG:-v0.23.0}
```

## Update Your Helm Chart

Update the `tag` in your `values.yaml` file to `v0.23.0`:

```yaml values.yaml
image:
  tag: ${IMAGE_TAG:-v0.23.0}
```

Upgrade the dittofeed chart:

```bash
helm upgrade --install dittofeed ./dittofeed/helm-charts/dittofeed
```
