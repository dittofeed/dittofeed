title: "Upgrading from v0.9.0 to v0.10.0"
---

Upgrading from v0.9.0 to v0.10.0 takes some care as it includes changes to the underlying ClickHouse schema. This guide will walk you through the necessary steps to upgrade your existing installation.

## Step 1: Setting Up Your `docker-compose.lite.yaml` File

First, add the environment variable `BOOTSTRAP: "false"` to your `docker-compose.lite.yaml` file. This will prevent your lite instance from running bootstrap operations when it restarts. 

Next, make sure you have an `admin-cli` instance specified in our `docker-compose.lite.yaml` file. We'll be using this service to run the upgrade scripts.

Your `docker-compose.lite.yaml` file should look something like this:

```yaml
...
services:
  lite:
    image: dittofeed/dittofeed-lite:${IMAGE_TAG:-v0.9.0}
    restart: always
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    depends_on:
      - postgres
      - temporal
      - clickhouse-server
    environment:
      <<: *backend-app-env
      # uncomment while upgrading dittofeed
      BOOTSTRAP: "false"
    env_file:
      - .env
    networks:
      - dittofeed-network-lite
  # useful for upgrading dittofeed
  admin-cli:
    image: dittofeed/dittofeed-lite:${IMAGE_TAG:-v0.10.0}
    entrypoint: []
    profiles: ["admin-cli"]
    command: tail -f /dev/null
    tty: true
    depends_on:
      - postgres
      - temporal
      - clickhouse-server
    environment:
      <<: *backend-app-env
    env_file:
      - .env
    networks:
      - dittofeed-network-lite
...
```

## Step 2: Start the `admin-cli` Service

Next, run the following command to start your `admin-cli` service:

```bash
docker compose --profile admin-cli -f docker-compose.lite.yaml up admin-cli -d
```

## Step 3: Run the Pre-Upgrade Script

Then run the following command to run the pre-upgrade script:

```bash
./scripts/admin-lite.sh upgrade-0-10-0-pre
```

## Step 4: Upgrade Your `docker-compose.lite.yaml` File

Upgrade the version in your docker-compose.lite.yaml file to v0.10.0:

```yaml
...
services:
  lite:
    image: dittofeed/dittofeed-lite:${IMAGE_TAG:-v0.10.0}
...
```

Now restart your lite instance:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.lite.yaml up lite -d --force-recreate
```

## Step 5: Run the Post-Upgrade Script

Finally, run the post-upgrade script:

```bash
./scripts/admin-lite.sh upgrade-0-10-0-post
```

And stop the `admin-cli` service:

```bash
docker compose --profile admin-cli -f docker-compose.lite.yaml stop admin-cli
```
