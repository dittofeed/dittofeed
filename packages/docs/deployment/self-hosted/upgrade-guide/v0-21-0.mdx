title: "Upgrading from v0.20.0 to v0.21.0"
---

Upgrading from v0.20.0 to v0.21.0 is more involved than other upgrades and involves several steps.

1. Upgrading to v0.20.0 prior to upgrading to v0.21.0
2. Running the postgres migrations
3. Creating new group tables and materialized views in ClickHouse

This guide will walk you through the process of upgrading your Dittofeed instance.

## Upgrading to v0.20.0

<Warning>
In this release we migrated from Prisma to Drizzle as our ORM. To upgrade to v0.21.0, you'll need to make sure you've upgraded Dittofeed to v0.20.0 and run its postgres migrations, prior to upgrading to v0.21.0.
</Warning>

See the [Upgrading from v0.19.0 to v0.20.0](/deployment/self-hosted/upgrade-guide/v0-20-0) guide for more information on upgrading to v0.20.0.

## Upgrade Dittofeed in Docker Compose

### Step 1: Setting Up Your `docker-compose.lite.yaml` File

First, add the environment variable `BOOTSTRAP: "false"` to your `docker-compose.lite.yaml` file, if it isn't set already. This will prevent your lite instance from running bootstrap operations when it restarts.

Next, make sure you have an `admin-cli` instance specified in our `docker-compose.lite.yaml` file. We'll be using this service to run our migrations.

Your `docker-compose.lite.yaml` file should look something like this:

```yaml
...
services:
  lite:
    image: dittofeed/dittofeed-lite:${IMAGE_TAG:-v0.20.0}
    restart: always
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    depends_on:
      - postgres
      - temporal
      - clickhouse-server
    environment:
      <<: *backend-app-env
      # uncomment while upgrading dittofeed
      BOOTSTRAP: "false"
    env_file:
      - .env
    networks:
      - dittofeed-network-lite
  # useful for upgrading dittofeed
  admin-cli:
    image: dittofeed/dittofeed-admin-cli:${IMAGE_TAG:-v0.21.0}
    entrypoint: []
    profiles: ["admin-cli"]
    command: tail -f /dev/null
    tty: true
    depends_on:
      - postgres
      - temporal
      - clickhouse-server
    environment:
      <<: *backend-app-env
    env_file:
      - .env
    networks:
      - dittofeed-network-lite
...
```

### Step 2: Start the `admin-cli` Service

Next, run the following command to start your `admin-cli` service:

```bash
docker compose --profile admin-cli -f docker-compose.lite.yaml up admin-cli -d
```

### Step 3: Run the Upgrade Script

Run the upgrade script to run postgres migrations and create the new clickhouse tables and views:

```bash
./admin.sh upgrade-0-21-0-pre
```

### Step 4: Upgrade Your `docker-compose.lite.yaml` File

Upgrade the version in your docker-compose.lite.yaml file to v0.21.0:

```yaml
...
services:
  lite:
    image: dittofeed/dittofeed-lite:${IMAGE_TAG:-v0.21.0}
...
```

Now restart your lite instance:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.lite.yaml up lite -d --force-recreate
```

### Step 5: Stop the `admin-cli` Service

Finally, stop the `admin-cli` service:

```bash
docker compose --profile admin-cli -f docker-compose.lite.yaml stop admin-cli
```

## Upgrade Dittofeed in Kubernetes

### Step 1: Setting Up Your dittofeed `values.yaml` File

First, add the environment variable `BOOTSTRAP: "false"` to your `values.yaml` file for the dittofeed helm chart, if it isn't set already. This will prevent your lite instance from running bootstrap operations when it restarts.

```yaml values.yaml
env:
  - name: BOOTSTRAP
    value: "false"
```

### Step 2: Install the `dittofeed-admin-cli` Chart

Next, run the following command to install the `dittofeed-admin-cli` chart:

```bash
helm upgrade --install dittofeed-admin-cli ./dittofeed/helm-charts/dittofeed-admin-cli
```

Make sure that the `dittofeed-admin-cli` pod is running the version of the `dittofeed-admin-cli` chart that you're upgrading to.

```yaml chart.yaml
appVersion: "v0.21.0"
```

Or set the `tag` in your `values.yaml` file to `v0.21.0`:

```yaml values.yaml
image:
  tag: v0.21.0
```

### Step 3: Run the Migrations

Run Dittofeed's database migrations before deploying the new version of Dittofeed:

Exec into the `dittofeed-admin-cli` pod:

```bash
kubectl exec -it deployment/dittofeed-admin-cli -- /bin/bash
```

Run the migrations:

```bash
./admin.sh upgrade-0-21-0-pre
```

### Step 4: Upgrade the Dittofeed Chart

Update the `tag` in your `values.yaml` file to `v0.21.0`:

```yaml values.yaml
image:
  tag: v0.21.0
```

Upgrade the dittofeed chart:

```bash
helm upgrade --install dittofeed ./dittofeed/helm-charts/dittofeed
```

### Step 5: Uninstall the `dittofeed-admin-cli` Helm Chart

Finally, uninstall the `dittofeed-admin-cli` deployment:

```bash
helm uninstall dittofeed-admin-cli
```
