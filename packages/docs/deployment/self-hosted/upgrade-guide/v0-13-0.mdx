title: "Upgrading from v0.12.1 to v0.13.1"
---

Upgrading from v0.12.1 to v0.13.1 is fairly straightforward, and only requires runing postgres migrations. This guide will walk you through the process of upgrading your Dittofeed instance.

## Step 1: Setting Up Your `docker-compose.lite.yaml` File

First, add the environment variable `BOOTSTRAP: "false"` to your `docker-compose.lite.yaml` file, if it isn't set already. This will prevent your lite instance from running bootstrap operations when it restarts. 

Next, make sure you have an `admin-cli` instance specified in our `docker-compose.lite.yaml` file. We'll be using this service to run our migrations.

Your `docker-compose.lite.yaml` file should look something like this:

```yaml
...
services:
  lite:
    image: dittofeed/dittofeed-lite:${IMAGE_TAG:-v0.12.1}
    restart: always
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    depends_on:
      - postgres
      - temporal
      - clickhouse-server
    environment:
      <<: *backend-app-env
      # uncomment while upgrading dittofeed
      BOOTSTRAP: "false"
    env_file:
      - .env
    networks:
      - dittofeed-network-lite
  # useful for upgrading dittofeed
  admin-cli:
    image: dittofeed/dittofeed-lite:${IMAGE_TAG:-v0.13.1}
    entrypoint: []
    profiles: ["admin-cli"]
    command: tail -f /dev/null
    tty: true
    depends_on:
      - postgres
      - temporal
      - clickhouse-server
    environment:
      <<: *backend-app-env
    env_file:
      - .env
    networks:
      - dittofeed-network-lite
...
```

## Step 2: Start the `admin-cli` Service

Next, run the following command to start your `admin-cli` service:

```bash
docker compose --profile admin-cli -f docker-compose.lite.yaml up admin-cli -d
```

## Step 3: Run the Migrations 

Run the migrations before deploying the new version of Dittofeed:

```bash
./scripts/admin-lite.sh prisma migrate deploy
```

## Step 4: Upgrade Your `docker-compose.lite.yaml` File

Upgrade the version in your docker-compose.lite.yaml file to v0.13.1:

```yaml
...
services:
  lite:
    image: dittofeed/dittofeed-lite:${IMAGE_TAG:-v0.13.1}
...
```

Now restart your lite instance:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.lite.yaml up lite -d --force-recreate
```

## Step 5: Stop the `admin-cli` Service

Finally, stop the `admin-cli` service:

```bash
docker compose --profile admin-cli -f docker-compose.lite.yaml stop admin-cli
```
