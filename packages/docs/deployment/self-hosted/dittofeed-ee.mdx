The dittofeed-ee application is a closed source extension of Dittofeed that includes additional features, like support for [multi-tenancy](/deployment/self-hosted/auth-modes/multi-tenant).

## Installation

To install dittofeed-ee, contact the Dittofeed team at [support@dittofeed.com](mailto:support@dittofeed.com) in order to receive a personal access token for our private docker image registry.

Once you have the token, you can install dittofeed-ee using our docker compose file or helm chart.

<Note>
  The dittofeed-ee image currently requires that you run it in [multi-tenant mode](/deployment/self-hosted/auth-modes/multi-tenant).
</Note>

### Docker Compose

First, login to the docker registry using your Dittofeed issued personal access token.

```bash
docker login -u <username> -p <personal-access-token> 
```

Create a .env file in the root directory with the environment variables described in the [multi-tenant auth mode docs](/deployment/self-hosted/auth-modes/multi-tenant).

```bash .env
OPEN_ID_CLIENT_ID='<your-auth0-client-id>'
OPEN_ID_CLIENT_SECRET='<your-auth0-client-secret>'
SECRET_KEY='<your-secret-key>'
AUTH_PROVIDER='auth0'
# Example: https://dittofeed.us.auth0.com/
OPEN_ID_ISSUER='https://<your-auth0-domain>.auth0.com/'
OPEN_ID_AUTHORIZATION_URL='https://<your-auth0-domain>.auth0.com/authorize'
OPEN_ID_TOKEN_URL='https://<your-auth0-domain>.auth0.com/oauth/token'
OPEN_ID_USER_INFO_URL='https://<your-auth0-domain>.auth0.com/userinfo'
ONBOARDING_URL='/dashboard-l/onboarding'
```

You will also need to set the environment variables described in the [multi-tenant auth mode docs](/deployment/self-hosted/auth-modes/multi-tenant) in your .env file.

Then, run our docker-compose.ee.yaml file.

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.ee.yaml up -d
```

### Helm Chart

Likewise, you can install dittofeed-ee using our helm chart. First, login to the docker registry using your Dittofeed issued personal access token.

```bash
docker login -u <username> -p <personal-access-token> 
```

First set the following values in your values.yaml file.


```yaml
ee:
  enabled: true

image:
  repository: dittofeed/dittofeed-ee
  tag: v0.22.0-ee.6

env:
  ...
  - name: ONBOARDING_URL
    value: "/dashboard-l/onboarding"
  - name: SIGNOUT_URL
    value: "/dashboard/signout"
  - name: AUTH_PROVIDER
    value: "auth0"
  # Example: https://dittofeed.us.auth0.com/
  - name: OPEN_ID_ISSUER
    value: "https://<your-auth0-domain>.auth0.com/"
  - name: OPEN_ID_AUTHORIZATION_URL
    value: "https://<your-auth0-domain>.auth0.com/authorize"
  - name: OPEN_ID_TOKEN_URL
    value: "https://<your-auth0-domain>.auth0.com/oauth/token"
  - name: OPEN_ID_USER_INFO_URL
    value: "https://<your-auth0-domain>.auth0.com/userinfo"
  - name: OPEN_ID_CLIENT_ID
    valueFrom:
      secretKeyRef:
        name: dittofeed-ee-auth0-client-id
        key: value
  - name: OPEN_ID_CLIENT_SECRET
    valueFrom:
      secretKeyRef:
        name: dittofeed-ee-auth0-client-secret
        key: value
  - name: SECRET_KEY
    valueFrom:
      secretKeyRef:
        name: dittofeed-ee-secret-key
        key: value
```

Then, install the helm chart.

```bash
helm install dittofeed dittofeed/dittofeed --values values.yaml
```
