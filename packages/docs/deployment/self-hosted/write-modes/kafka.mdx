title: Kafka Write Mode
description: Buffer data in Kafka before writing to ClickHouse
---

The `kafka` write mode buffers data in Kafka before writing it to ClickHouse. This mode is useful when you have a high volume of data and want to avoid overwhelming ClickHouse. This mode takes advantage of ClickHouse's [kafka table engine](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/integrations/kafka/kafka-table-engine).
