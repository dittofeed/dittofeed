## Visit the Dashboard

You can now visit the dashboard, whose URL is listed on the dashboard service page.

## Submit Data to the API

You can submit data to your instance of the Dittofeed API by retrieving the API's url.

Then you can provide this url to the Dittofeed SDK.

```javascript
DittofeedSdk.init({
 writeKey: '...',
 host: 'https://PLACEHOLDER.onrender.com',
});
```

## Admin CLI

By default, the Admin CLI is deployed as a worker service. You can access the Admin CLI by accessing the service's shell `https://dashboard.render.com/worker/<service-id>/shell`.

The admin-cli's primary use is in facilitating version upgrades to Dittofeed.

You can delete the Admin CLI service in its settings when you don't need it anymore and redeploy it by manually resyncing Dittofeed's blueprint.
