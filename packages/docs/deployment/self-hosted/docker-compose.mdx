title: Self-Host with Docker Compose
---

This section outlines the necessary steps to run Dittofeed with docker compose.

First, clone Dittofeed's github repository.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:ideamarketinc/dittofeed.git
cd dittofeed
```

Next create a local `.env` file.

```bash
touch .env
```

Dittofeed has dependencies on Postgres, and Clickhouse, with an optional Kafka dependency.

Populate this `.env` file with the following values, substituting placeholder values with your own.

```properties .env
DATABASE_HOST=my-postgres-host
DATABASE_USER=my-postgres-user
DATABASE_PASSWORD=my-postgres-password
CLICKHOUSE_USER=my-clickhouse-user
CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD=my-clickhouse-password
```

Finally, start Dittofeed's services, and run Dittofeed's bootstrap script.

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yaml up -d
# Run once the above services have successfully started.
./scripts/bootstrap.sh
```

<Warning>
The above command will start Postgres, Clickhouse, and Kafka dependencies. You may decide to use a third party vendor for these data stores. In that case, you should disable the corresponding services in the `docker-compose.prod.yaml` file.
</Warning>
