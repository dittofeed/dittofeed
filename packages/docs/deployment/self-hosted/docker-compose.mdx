First, clone Dittofeed's github repository.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:dittofeed/dittofeed.git
cd dittofeed
```

## Overridde Default Environment Variables

It's important that you override the default environment variables in the `.env` file, for security reasons.

<Info>
Dittofeed has dependencies on Postgres, and Clickhouse, with an optional Kafka dependency.
</Info>

To start, create a local `.env` file.

```bash
touch .env
```

Then uncomment the following lines from [`docker-compose.lite.yaml`](https://github.com/dittofeed/dittofeed/blob/main/docker-compose.lite.yaml):

```yaml docker-compose.lite.yaml
# README: To add local env variables uncomment the following line and add a .env file in the root directory
env_file:
  - .env
```


Populate this `.env` file with the following values, substituting placeholder values with your own. Dittofeed will work without these overrides, but it is recommended that you substitute your own credentials.

```properties .env
# Used to generate links to the dashboard e.g. for unsubscribe links. Should not
# include the /dashboard suffix.
DASHBOARD_URL="https://my-dittofeed-dashboard.com"
# Used to issue requests to the api from the dashboard. Should not include the
# /api suffix. Can be the same as the DASHBOARD_URL.
DASHBOARD_API_BASE="https://my-dittofeed-api.com"
DATABASE_USER=my-postgres-user
DATABASE_PASSWORD=my-postgres-password
CLICKHOUSE_USER=my-clickhouse-user
CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD=my-clickhouse-password
PASSWORD=password
SECRET_KEY=GEGL1RHjFVOxIO80Dp8+ODlZPOjm2IDBJB/UunHlf3c=
```

See our documentation on [Authentication Modes](/deployment/self-hosted/auth-modes) for instructions on how to generate a new `SECRET_KEY`.

Finally, start Dittofeed's services.

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.lite.yaml up -d
```

<Warning>
  The above command will start Postgres and Clickhouse. You
  may decide to use a third party vendor for these data stores. In that case,
  you should disable the corresponding services in the
  `docker-compose.prod.yaml` file.
</Warning>
