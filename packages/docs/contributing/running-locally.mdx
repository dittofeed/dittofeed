title: Running Dittofeed Locally
---

To run Dittofeed locally, start docker compose, and then run the development bootstrap script.

```bash
docker compose --profile apps up -d
# The bootstrap script will run migrations and seed data stores with default
# resources.
yarn admin bootstrap
```

`yarn admin <cmd> [args]` invoke's the `admin-cli` package's CLI, located [here](https://github.com/dittofeed/dittofeed/tree/main/packages/admin-cli). The `admin-cli` package can be used for local development as well as operational tasks in production.

## Developing a Dittofeed Service

Dittofeed has three services.

1. Dashboard
2. API
3. Worker

If you want to run a particular application while making changes to it, you will
want to run that application in the foreground outside of docker compose.

### Dashboard

```bash
docker compose --profile apps-dashboard up -d
yarn workspace dashboard dev
```

### API

```bash
docker compose --profile apps-api up -d
yarn workspace api dev
```

### Worker

```bash
docker compose --profile apps-worker up -d
yarn workspace worker dev
```

## Running Locally With OpenTelemetry

In order to run Dittofeed locally with OpenTelemetry (OTEL), start the API or dashboard with the following environment variables.

<CodeGroup>
```bash dashboard
START_OTEL=true yarn workspace dashboard dev
```

```bash API
START_OTEL=true yarn workspace api dev
```

```bash worker
START_OTEL=true yarn workspace worker dev
```
</CodeGroup>

Then run the docker compose dependencies with the otel profile.

```bash
docker compose --profile otel up -d
```
