title: "Accessing the Admin API"
---

The Admin API allows you to manage your Dittofeed workspace programmatically. These endpoints are prefixed with the path `/api/admin`. Unlike public `/api/public` endpoints, Admin API endpoints require an Admin API key.

## Creating an Admin API Key

Admin API keys can be created from the settings page [`/dashboard/settings#admin-api-key`](https://dittofeed.com/dashboard/settings#admin-api-key).

Once an Admin API key is created, its value can't be read again. Make sure to write it down and store it securely.

## Using an Admin API Token

To authenticate with the Admin API, include the Admin API key in the `Authorization` header of your requests.

```
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```
