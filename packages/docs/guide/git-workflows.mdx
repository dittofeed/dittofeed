title: Git Based Workflows
---

Dittofeed’s git based workflows allows your whole team to make changes to your user messaging safely and reliably, while providing an easy way for your whole growth team to collaborate effectively with its engineers.

Check your messaging resources into git, make changes in a branch through the UI, and then submit a PR to github.  We're thankful for the great work done by the team at [Retool](https://retool.com/), which served as inspiration for this feature.
