Dittofeed emits internal events on your behalf to power analytics, journey logic, and status tracking. These are stored in the event stream just like user-submitted events and can be used in segments and journeys.

Status events include email and SMS outcomes like delivered, opened, clicked, bounced, spam, and failures. These typically originate from provider webhooks (e.g., SendGrid, Postmark, Twilio).

Below is a reference of the internal event types and their purpose.

## Event Types

- `DFInternalMessageSent` — Recorded when a message send succeeds (email, SMS, webhook, mobile push). Includes channel-specific info and message tags (e.g., `workspaceId`, `journeyId`, `nodeId`, `templateId`, `messageId`, `userId`, `channel`). Webhook requests omit values provided via `secret` to avoid storing sensitive data.
- `DFBadWorkspaceConfiguration` — Emitted when misconfiguration prevents sending or processing (e.g., missing/invalid provider credentials, template errors, invalid message definition, missing provider).
- `DFMessageFailure` — Non-retryable send failures (e.g., authorization errors, invalid configuration at provider, definitive 4xx responses). Transient/retryable issues (e.g., brief network errors/timeouts, throttling, 5xx) are retried rather than emitting a failure event.
- `DFMessageSkipped` — Message was intentionally not sent due to business rules. Variants include:
  - MissingIdentifier: required identifier (e.g., email or phone) not present.
  - SubscriptionState: user’s subscription state disallows sending (Opt-in/Opt-out semantics).
- `DFSegmentBroadcast` — Emitted to users included in a Broadcast. Useful for building segments like “performed SegmentBroadcast for segment X”. Properties include `segmentId`.
- `DFSubscriptionChange` — Emitted when a user’s subscription group state changes. Properties: `subscriptionId`, `action` (Subscribe | Unsubscribe).
- `DFEmailDropped` — Email was dropped by the provider (e.g., suppression, invalid address). Originates from email provider webhooks.
- `DFEmailDelivered` — Email delivered to the recipient’s server (provider webhook).
- `DFEmailOpened` — Email open tracked by the provider (provider webhook).
- `DFEmailProcessed` — Email accepted for processing by the provider (pre-delivery status; provider webhook).
- `DFEmailClicked` — Email link click tracked by the provider (provider webhook).
- `DFEmailBounced` — Email bounced (provider webhook).
- `DFEmailMarkedSpam` — Recipient reported email as spam (provider webhook).
- `DFSmsDelivered` — SMS delivered (provider webhook).
- `DFSmsFailed` — SMS send failed (provider webhook).
- `DFJourneyNodeProcessed` — A journey node executed for a user. Properties include `journeyId`, `nodeId`, `type` (node type), and `eventKey`.
- `DFManualSegmentUpdate` — A manual segment’s membership changed. Properties: `segmentId`, `version`, `inSegment` (0 or 1).
- `DFAttachedFiles` — Files attached to an event were persisted to blob storage and referenced in properties. Value is a map of file name to blob storage metadata.
- `DFUserTrackSignal` — Internal signal for track-based coordination. Reserved for system workflows.
- `DFGroupUserAssignment` — A group received/removed a user. Properties: `userId`, `assigned` (true/false). Emitted when handling group events.
- `DFUserGroupAssignment` — A user was assigned/removed from a group. Properties: `groupId`, `assigned` (true/false). Emitted when handling group events.
- `DFJourneyEarlyExit` — Journey execution ended early (e.g., journey not running, max retries reached). Properties include a human-readable `message`.

## Notes

- Status events used for delivery analytics include: `DFEmailDropped`, `DFEmailDelivered`, `DFEmailOpened`, `DFEmailClicked`, `DFEmailBounced`, `DFEmailMarkedSpam`, `DFSmsDelivered`, `DFSmsFailed`.
- Internal events appear as `track` events and can be filtered in segments just like user events.
- Message-related internal events also carry message tags that enable attribution within analytics and journeys.

## Retries

- Providers may signal retryability. For example, Amazon SES marks retryable errors with `$retryable = true`; these are retried and do not emit `DFMessageFailure`.
- After exhausting retries in journey execution, the system may emit `DFJourneyEarlyExit` with a message indicating the retry exhaustion rather than a failure event.
