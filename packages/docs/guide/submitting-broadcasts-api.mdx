In addition to sending broadcasts via the UI, you can also submit broadcasts via the API. See the `POST /admin/broadcasts/execute` [endpoint](/api-reference/auto/broadcasts/post-apiadminbroadcastsexecute).

For convience, you can construct a broadcast in the UI, and then export the broadcast as a sample CURL request.
