The "View in Browser" feature allows email recipients to view your messages in their web browser. This is useful when:

- Email clients don't render the email correctly
- Users want to see the full email without downloading images
- Users are viewing emails on devices with limited rendering capabilities

## Prerequisites

This feature requires [blob storage](/deployment/self-hosted/blob-storage) to be enabled. When an email is sent, the rendered HTML is stored in blob storage and can be accessed via a secure URL.

## Usage

Add the `view_in_browser_url` tag to your email template to generate a link:

```html
<a href="{% view_in_browser_url %}" target="_blank">View in browser</a>
```

### MJML Example

A common pattern is to place the view-in-browser link at the top of your email:

```html
<mjml>
  <mj-body>
    <mj-section>
      <mj-column>
        <mj-text align="center" color="#888888" font-size="12px">
          Having trouble viewing this email?
          <a href="{% view_in_browser_url %}" target="_blank">View in browser</a>
        </mj-text>
      </mj-column>
    </mj-section>

    <!-- Rest of your email content -->

  </mj-body>
</mjml>
```

## How It Works

1. When an email is sent, the fully rendered HTML (with all user properties substituted) is stored in blob storage
2. The `view_in_browser_url` tag generates a secure URL with a cryptographic hash
3. When a recipient clicks the link, they're taken to a page that displays the stored email HTML
4. The URL is unique to each message and cannot be guessed or enumerated

## Security

- Each view-in-browser URL contains a cryptographic hash that validates the request
- URLs are specific to individual messages and cannot be used to access other users' emails
- The hash is generated using a workspace-specific secret

## Limitations

- The URL will render an empty string in template previews (since no message has been sent yet)
- Requires blob storage to be configured and enabled
- The stored email reflects the content at the time of sending; subsequent template changes won't affect previously sent emails
