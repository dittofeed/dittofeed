## Omni-channel Customer Engagement Platform

Like Braze, One-Signal, Customer.io, and Segment Engage. Create automated user journeys to message users along any channel: email, SMS, mobile push notifications, and custom webhooks.

<br />

## Developer-centric

Beyond having industry-standard GUI tools, we focus on developer happiness with first-in-class dev-focused features:

* Branch-based git worflows that support marketing campaign version control.
* Write email templates in your favorite editor, checked into git - not in an un-versioned web based IDE.
* Testing SDK to test your marketing campaigns in CI. No more manually QAing them in production.
* Self-hostable. Protect your sensitive PII inside of your own VPC. Avoid volume-based pricing.
* Journey monitoring and alerting.
* More to come.

<br />
