<h2 align="center">Open-source customer engagement</h3>

[Dittofeed](https://dittofeed.com) is an omni-channel customer engagement platform. Send broadcasts or create automated user journeys to message users along any channel: email, mobile push notifications, SMS, WhatsApp, Slack, and more. We're an open source, dev-friendly alternative to platforms like OneSignal, Customer.io, and Segment Engage.

## üîß Development Build & Deployment (For Team Members)

This repository contains **custom modifications** to the Dittofeed open source codebase. The `docker-compose.lite.yaml` file has been configured to automatically build the Docker image from the `packages/lite/Dockerfile` instead of using pre-built images. If you need to run your changes locally or deploy them, follow these steps:

### Quick Start for Development

```bash
# Run the application with docker-compose (automatically builds the image)
docker compose -f docker-compose.lite.yaml up -d

# Or force a rebuild if you've made changes
docker compose -f docker-compose.lite.yaml up -d --build
```

### What's Different from Open Source

This fork includes the following **custom changes**:

#### üêõ **Keyed Performed Segment Bug Fix**
- **Issue**: "Keyed performed" segments in event-triggered journeys were not evaluating correctly when subsequent events (e.g., `CHECK_OUT`) occurred after journey entry (e.g., `ADD_TO_CART`)
- **Root Cause**: Events with different names weren't being routed to existing keyed workflows for segment re-evaluation
- **Fix**: Enhanced event routing system to signal existing keyed workflows across different event types
- **Files Modified**:
  - `packages/backend-lib/src/journeys.ts` - Added `signalExistingKeyedWorkflows()` function
  - `packages/backend-lib/src/journeys/userWorkflow/lifecycle.ts` - Fixed workflow signaling when workflows already exist

#### üîÑ **How This Fixes Our Use Case**

![Dittofeed Journey Builder](journey.png)

**Before (Broken):**
```
User: ADD_TO_CART (cartId: "123") ‚Üí Journey starts
Journey: Enters wait-for "checkedOut" segment
User: CHECK_OUT (cartId: "123") ‚Üí Event dropped (name mismatch)
Journey: Times out ‚Üí Sends reminder ‚ùå
```

**After (Fixed):**
```
User: ADD_TO_CART (cartId: "123") ‚Üí Journey starts
Journey: Enters wait-for "checkedOut" segment
User: CHECK_OUT (cartId: "123") ‚Üí Event signaled to existing workflow ‚úÖ
Workflow: Receives event ‚Üí Updates segment ‚Üí Journey proceeds ‚úÖ
```

### Development Workflow

1. **Run the application** (automatically builds the image):
   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker-compose.lite.yaml up -d
   ```
2. **Force rebuild** if you've made changes:
   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker-compose.lite.yaml up -d --build
   ```
3. **View logs** (if needed):
   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker-compose.lite.yaml logs -f
   ```
4. **Stop the application**:
   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker-compose.lite.yaml down
   ```

### Syncing with Upstream

To pull in updates from the original Dittofeed repository:

```bash
# Add upstream remote (one time setup)
git remote add upstream https://github.com/dittofeed/dittofeed.git

# Fetch upstream changes
git fetch upstream

# Merge upstream changes (be careful with conflicts)
git merge upstream/main
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: When merging upstream changes, be careful not to overwrite our custom bug fixes!
