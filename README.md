## Open-source customer engagement

[Dittofeed](https://dittofeed.com) is an omni-channel customer engagement platform. Create automated user journeys to message users along any channel: email, mobile push notifications, SMS, custom webhooks, Slack, and more. We're an open source, dev-friendly alternative to platforms like OneSignal, Customer.io, and Segment Engage.

## Developer-centric

Beyond having industry-standard GUI tools, we focus on developer happiness with first-in-class dev-focused features:

- Branch-based git worflows that support messaging campaign version control.
- Write email templates in your favorite editor, checked into git - not in an unversioned web based IDE.
- Testing SDK to test your messaging campaigns in CI. No more manually QAing them in production.
- Self-hostable. Protect your sensitive PII inside of your own VPC. Avoid volume-based pricing.
- Journey monitoring and alerting.

More to come...
