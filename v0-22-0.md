## Dittofeed v022.0 Release Notes

Hello everyone, **v0.22.0** is an important release for Dittofeed, our open-source customer engagement platform.

We’ve opened up dittofeed-ee, from a few select customers, to the broader public. This extension to Dittofeed includes support for multi-tenancy, with the ability to host multiple workspaces on the same Dittofeed instance.

We’ve also made major improvements to the UX of our users table along with various bug fixes and improvements.

## Release Highlights

### New: dittofeed-ee

dittofeed-ee is a closed source extension to Dittofeed that supports multi-tenancy. Multi-tenancy, via the `multi-tenant` auth mode, enables multiple workspaces to be hosted from the same instance of Dittofeed. It also supports authenticating dashboard members separately.

This feature has been in a closed beta with several of our long-time self-hosting users, and we’re releasing it publicly for the first time!

If you’re interested in trying it out, contact us at [support@dittofeed.com](mailto:support@dittofeed.com) and we’ll send you an access token!

See our docs for more information:

### Improved: Users Table UX

In this release we’ve made several substantial UX improvements to the users tables through the application. This includes:

- Improved performance
- Additional filtering, by subscription group
- Bug fixes for pagination
- Refresh and auto-refresh buttons

and more!

## Fix: Journey Builder

We made a fix to our journey builder which could prevent journey edits from being persisted under some configurations.

### Fix: Postmark Error Handling

We made improvements to our Postmark error handling, which could previously mark emails as successfully sent under some conditions. Specifically, when postmark responds with a 200 status, but presents an error code, we should mark an error, and not retry.

That’s all folks! This release brings some exciting new features and improvements, with dittofeed-ee and our new users table.
