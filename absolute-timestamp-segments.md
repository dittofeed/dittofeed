We're going to add a new segment operator type to Trait and Performed segments.

Trait absolute date segments will allow segments to define the set of users e.g.

- Users whose `registeredAt` is after 2025-01-01

Performed absolute date segments will allow segments to define the set of users e.g.

- Users who have performed 3 `BUTTON_CLICKS` after 2025-01-01

This is in contrast to the existing `Within` logic
