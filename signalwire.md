# SignalWire

We're implementing SignalWire as a destination for Dittofeed, an open-source customer engagement platform. We'll be using SignalWire's SDK/API to send SMS messages.

This will be used in the context of "broadcasts" for one-off batch sends, and "journeys" for automatic sends based on users' traits and behaviors.

## Implementation

### 1. Implement Types

### 2. Implement Destination

### 3. Implement Webhook
