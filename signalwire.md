# SignalWire

We're implementing SignalWire as a destination for Dittofeed, an open-source customer engagement platform. We'll be using SignalWire's SDK/API to send SMS messages.

This will be used in the context of "broadcasts" for one-off batch sends, and "journeys" for automatic sends based on users' traits and behaviors.

## Resources

- Please refer to .tmp/signalwire-perplexity.md for information on how to use the SignalWire API.
